#### I. INTRODUCTION:

Centre for Research and integrated Development (CeRID) is a non-governmental organization and an agent of change for peaceful and self-reliant communities through implementation of equitable programmes in climate smart and resilient agriculture, education and skills development, environment and Natural Resource Management (NRM), economic empowerment and livelihoods, nutrition and hygiene improvement, and peace building and conflict transformation. Through our public-private-partnership (PPP) approach we contribute to sustainable food security and promote climate smart agriculture practices and adaptation in Somalia by linking farmers with technology transfer. CeRID's 2021-2025 strategy introduces the establishment of centrally planned seed system with well-coordinated breeding, testing, production, processing and marketing that deliver homogeneous and improved maize, sorghum, cowpea and sesame seed varieties with Valleyseed Enterprise.

Valleyseed enterprise is an innovative research and enterprise entity and affiliate with Sayid Mohammed Technical Education College (SaMTEC). Valleyseed is active in research, plant breeding, seed production and marketing of certified seeds. The aim of Valleyseed is to provide Horn of African farmers with best quality and high-yielding seed varieties. Valleyseed Enterprise focuses on formal seed systems and produces improved hybrid and foundation seed varieties. Valleyseed Enterprise has a strong research collaboration with Centre for Research and Integrated Development (CeRID) and other regional research institutions including but not limited to CIMMYT.

#### II. BACKGROUND:

The seed sector in Somalia is under-developed and are predominantly informal with very few companies providing quality seeds to farmers. The semblance of a formal seed system is quite week and nascent. Most Farmers use farm-saved seeds for their field and local crops---mainly maize, sorghum, cowpea, rice, and sesame. The weak regulatory systems to oversee and develop scientific protocol for testing, inspection, and certification on quality parameters such as purity and germination rates has resulted in low productivity. Globally, Somalia's yield per hectare for almost all agricultural crops remains the lowest. Somali Agriculture Regulatory and Inspection Service (SARIS) under the Federal Ministry of Agriculture has the mandate of seed certification and overall regulatory enforcement, and Valleyseed Enterprise is registered by SARIS and licenced for quality maize, sorghum and cowpea seeds production and marketing

#### III. OBJECTIVES OF TEH STUDEY

The overall objective of this study is to carry out a Value Chain Analysis of seed systems with particular focus on maize, sorghum, cowpea and sesame seeds and determine the role and availability of local seeds, seed saving and seed acquisition, provision of seed by farmers, the provision of seed by traders and understanding seed constraints as well as the viability of breeding, multiplication and marketing of hybrid and open pollinated seed varieties. In particular, the value chain study should shed light on the status of existing and potential markets and determine which seed crop hold promise of value addition opportunities, product expansion and market viability.

**The specific objectives are:**

- To conduct a comprehensive study/analysis of seed system in Jubaland and neighboring districts of Kenya and Ethiopia with a particular focus on maize, sorghum, cowpea and sesame seeds.

#### IV. TASKS REQUIRED

- Identification of methods of data collection, and presenting plan of action of data collection, data analysis, report writing and presentation of findings.

- Identification of the institutions that provides germplasm and improved parental seeds.

- Submitting inception report of the study.

- Identification of farmers/producers' access to seeds, sources of seeds and availability of improved seeds.

- Mapping and identification of primary actors who undertake input supply (e.g., seeds, fertilizers etc.), on-farm production, post-harvest (storage, processing etc.), marketing and market actors (wholesale, retail, traders, middlemen) and consumption

- Mapping the secondary actors, who perform support service roles for primary functions such as transportation, brokerage, and service processing.

- Mapping types of farmers, including smallholders and commercial farmers and their primary crops.

- Mapping existing and enabling environment (infrastructures and policies, institutions and processes that shape the market environment) and service (business and extension) providers.

- Identifying critical factors and trends affecting the seeds value chain environment and operating conditions, (e.g., national and local authorities, research agencies) and government/institutions (policies, regulations and practices) that are beyond the direct control of economic actors in the value chain.

- Identify different services (e.g., market information, financial services, and quality assurance) that support, or could potentially support and add value, the overall efficiency of value chain.

- Drafting and presenting the results of findings with clear recommendations and proposed strategies for dealing with the identified seed value chain analysis challenges.

#### V. DELIVERABLES

- Inception report outlining data collection methodology, plan of action including field data collection and completion timeframe.

- Draft seed value chain study for review and power point presentation of the findings.

- Submitting not more than 20 pages final seed (maize, sorghum, cowpea and sesame) value chain study report (annexes can be separate).
