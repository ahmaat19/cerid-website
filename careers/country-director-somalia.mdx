### INTRODUCTION

Centre for Research and Integrated Development (CeRID) is an independent, impartial, NonGovernmental, and Non-profit making development organisation founded in 2005. It is registered in Somalia and Kenya and has field operation offices in Mogadishu, Jubbaland, and Southwest Federal Member States of Somalia. CeRID has its headquarters in Belet-Hawa town of Somalia, bordering Mandera Kenya from where it provides programme and operational support to all offices.

Centre for Research and Integrated Development's (CeRID's) 2021-2025 strategy builds on its existing expertise in fragile context, recovery programming practice, and resilience-building through partnerships, and deepens and consolidates the gains made in the past. The strategy takes a new direction and focuses on institutional sustainability, strong partnership with both target communities and our international and national partners to tackle the root causes of poverty and vulnerability.

Throughout the timeframe of this strategy, we plan to implement programs in climate-smart agriculture, recovery and resilience building, education and skills development, economic empowerment, and livelihood protection. Partnership building and stakeholder engagement is the major area of our focus through 2025.

The strategy introduces an element of institutional sustainability and self-supported programs by introducing agriculture and agri-business value chain through the propagation of climate-appropriate seeds, seed cleaning, seed treating, and seed marketing initiative.

The strategy also unveils approaches and methods to enhance public-private-partnership through collaboration with and engagement of financial institutions, United Nations, International Development Cooperation, Research institutions, and above all the existing international and national partners, and Non-Governmental Organisation (NGOs). Equally, the strategy focuses on bi-lateral partnership with Federal Government (FG) and Federal Member State (FMS) institutions.
