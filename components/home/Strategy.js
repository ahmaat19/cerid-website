              The organization is currently running four programmes which are;
              education and skills development, WASH – Water, Sanitation &
              Health, NRM – Natural Resource Management and Livelihoods &
              Environment and Social Justice. Under the education and skills
              development project, the organization is currently supporting 17
              primary schools, one secondary school and SAMTEC (www.samtec.so),
              the only TVET – Technical and Vocational Education and Training
              center which has assisted over 3,000 youths and women to acquire
              vocational and technical skills. The vocational skills training
              programme was expanded from the Gedo region to Kismayo town in
              2016 following the finalization of SAMTEC strategic plan and later
              to Bardere town.

              The NRM and livelihoods has been focusing on capacity building on
              NRM, support to cash for work, tree planting, regeneration of
              natural resources, and promotion of farming technologies such as
              kitchen gardens, farmer training on GAP, promotion of savings and
              loans and other IGAs and use of cash-based interventions to
              improve on communal assets. In addition, the livelihoods and NRM
              programs supports advocacy initiatives around environmental
              protection and encourages farmers to focus on farming as a
              business. Under the environment and social justice programme, the
              focus was on peace building and conflict transformation through
              peace building initiatives such as peace clubs, peace outreaches,
              media peace advocacy and use of community structures. The WASH
              programme has increased access to water, sanitation and hygiene
              and operates in the Gedo region districts of Belet-Hawa and Luuq.
